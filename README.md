# Dungeon_Game

A friend and I made this little game with the Unity Game Engine. The game is incomplete, but there is a little web demo [here](https://lordbenedikt.github.io/dungeon_game_webgl/).
I wrote a script for procedurally generating levels with increasing difficult, but at the moment level generation is swapped out for a static level, because the script is
still basic and doesn't add as much detail to the levels as we do manually. Right now we are not working on this project anymore, but might pick it up at some point in the
future.
